### introduction
- (1) Based on universal large language model and multimodal model.
- (2) By integrating diverse data types and disease profiles, including rich and comprehensive medical information such as medical texts and images, we can leverage cross-modal data learning to extract insights from disparate data sources, ultimately enabling more accurate diagnoses and effective treatments.

### As the project is still ongoing, only some application achievements will be presented here
