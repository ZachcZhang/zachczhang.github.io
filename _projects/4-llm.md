Medical MLLM Agent (Project in Progress), this service is a collaboration with Guangzhou LBP Medicine Science & Technology Co., Ltd.(688393.SH). Based on the MLLM Agent, it aims to complete multimodal retrieval and generation of a case library. It can search patient case records, diagnostic images, and other medical records, and provide MLLM consultation, offering reliable diagnostic assistance to medical personnel and patients. We are still conducting this research.
