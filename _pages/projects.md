    <p>This is the first open-source project applying the SAM model to real-time annotation of whole slide images (WSI) in the medical field which I developed. This project utilizes models from the SAM family (e.g., SAM, SAM2, etc.) to assist medical personnel in annotating WSI case slides, significantly improving the speed and efficiency of medical researchers' annotation work. It provides accurate and reliable data for model training.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>Medical MLLM Agent (Project in Progress), this service is a collaboration with Guangzhou LBP Medicine Science & Technology Co., Ltd.(688393.SH). Based on the MLLM Agent, it aims to complete multimodal retrieval and generation of a case library. It can search patient case records, diagnostic images, and other medical records, and provide MLLM consultation, offering reliable diagnostic assistance to medical personnel and patients. We are still conducting this research.</p>
