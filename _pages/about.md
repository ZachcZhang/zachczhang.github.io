I am currently a Research Assistant in the Medical Data Intelligence Lab at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). 

Before joining HKUST (GZ), I worked as an software engineer at Tencent. I also gained experience as an intern at Tencent (2020) and Lenovo Research (2019). I earned my B.E. degree from Beijing Jiaotong University under the supervision of Prof. [Guofang Fan](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/eaie/9079.html) and completed my M.Sc. in Telecommunications at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I was guided by Prof. [Danny Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/).

My research interests include large language models (LLMs), RAG and multimodal learning. My goal is to become a researcher who effectively bridges theory with practical applications.
