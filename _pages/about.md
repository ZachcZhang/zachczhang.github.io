I am currently a Research Assistant in the Medical Data Intelligence Lab at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), supervised by Professor Lei Chen.

Before joining HKUST (GZ), I served as a DevOps Software Engineer on Tencent's enterprise payment project, where I was responsible for payment systems for Sam's Club, CCTV, and Li-Ning. I also gained experience as an intern at Tencent(2020) and Lenovo Research(2019). I obtained an MSc in Telecommunications from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in November 2020, under the supervision of Professor Danny Hin-Kwok Tsang. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University in June 2019, supervised by Professor Guofang Fan.

My research interests include large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal learning, and few-shot learning. My goal is to become a researcher who effectively bridges theory with practical applications.
